# CVDebug

A helper debugging tool for any application using the [OpenCV library](http://opencv.org/).

## Motivation

The motivation for this tool is the inability to simultaneously debug your application and view visual information in OpenCV, such as images - while your application is paused in the debugger, the only way to display the data is through hexadecimal memory dump. If you manage to display the image into a window (like through `imshow`), you lose the ability to show the image and work with it once you pause the debugger.

A project with similar goal was started alongside this project for the Visual Studio - [Image Watch](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e682d542-7ef3-402c-b857-bbfba714f78d), showing the necessity for such tool. Our approach is better, because it is not bound to a specific IDE or an operating system - it is truly multiplatform.

## Overview

This tool consist of a helper library, which you link into your application, and a separate visualization application. These two components communicate over [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/) and allow the transfer of images from the library to the application. If the CVDebugger application is not running, the library acts as if nothing happened, allowing you to run your application "without debug mode".

## Usage

The application stores a number of images in memory in a circular buffer and shows you a list of images with the following info:

* name of the image - coming from your application
* the resolution of the image
* the element type and number of channels

When you click on an image thumbnail in the list, a full view of the image appears in the main area, allowing you to zoom in on the image and view individual pixel data. 

## Debugging API

The library `cvdebug` has a very simple API - it provides only the following function:

    void cvdebug_image(const cv::Mat &image, const std::string &name);

If the CVDebugger application is started, the given image is sent to the visualizer and its thumbnail appears in the list along with the name you specified. If it is not started, nothing happens. In any case, this function does not block.

You can format the name of the image to give additional information, for example:

    cvdebug_image(myimage, format("My image %d / %d", i, total));

The `format` function is provided by the OpenCV library.
